- Functionality/performance improvements:
    - Investigate solutions for poller performance improvement.
    - Investigate solutions for multiple communities per device.
    - Eliminate interface churn for transient interfaces (e.g. ppp/tun) on
      net-snmp.

- Consider adding some non-monitoring administrative functions:
    - enabling/disabling ports
    - changing access port VLANs
    - editing port labels

- Integrate as many usability improvements as time permits:
    - Front page: more automation; GUI configuration
